# RAG with multiple input Source

Limitations of traditional single-source RAG Q&A systems:-

Limited Knowledge Base: A single source, like Wikipedia, might not have all the information needed to answer a complex question accurately. This can lead to incomplete or inaccurate answers.
Bias and Echo Chambers: A single source can have inherent biases or a specific viewpoint. RAG trained solely on that source might inherit those biases and struggle with questions requiring a broader perspective.
Outdated Information: Static knowledge bases might not be updated frequently, leading RAG to provide outdated information for topics that evolve rapidly.
Limited Context Understanding: While RAG can analyze retrieved documents, a single source might lack the context diversity needed to fully understand the nuances of a question.
These limitations can hinder the overall effectiveness and robustness of a RAG Q&A system.
